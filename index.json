Dynamically priced cloud resources such as the Amazon EC2 Spot Instance provides an efficient mechanism for cloud service providers to trade resources with potential buyers using an auction mechanism. With the dynamically priced cloud resource markets, cloud consumers can buy resources at a significantly lower cost than statically priced cloud resources such as the on-demand instances in Amazon EC2. While dynamically priced cloud resources enable to maximize datacenter resource utilization and minimize cost for the consumers, unfortunately, such auction mechanisms achieve these benefits only at a cost significant of private information leakage. In an auction-based mechanism, the private information includes information on the demands of the consumers that can lead an attacker to understand the current computing requirements of the consumers and perhaps even allow the inference of the workload patterns of the consumers. In this paper, we propose PADS, a strategy-proof differentially private auction mechanism that allows cloud providers to privately trade resources with cloud consumers in such a way that individual bidding information of the cloud consumers is not exposed by the auction mechanism. We demonstrate that PADS achieves differential privacy and approximate truthfulness guarantees while maintaining good performance in terms of revenue gains and allocation efficiency. We evaluate PADS through extensive simulation experiments that demonstrate that in comparison to traditional auction mechanisms, PADS achieves relatively high revenues for cloud providers while guaranteeing the privacy of the participating consumers.","tags":null,"title":"PADS: Privacy-preserving Auction Design forAllocating Dynamically Priced Cloud Resources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinlai Xu","Balaji Palanisamy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498348800,"objectID":"a7345b0d6380b2b01c7303e776c15932","permalink":"https://singkru.github.io/publication/contract-cloud-2017/","publishdate":"2017-06-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/contract-cloud-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Cloud computing and its pay-as-you-go model continue to provide significant cost benefits and a seamless service delivery model for cloud consumers.

Edge Computing provides an additional layer of infrastructure to fill latency gaps between the IoT devices and the back-end computing infrastructure. In the edge computing model, small-scale micro-datacenters that represent ad-hoc and distributed collection of computing infrastructure pose new challenges in terms of management and effective resource sharing to achieve a globally efficient resource allocation. In this paper, we propose Zenith, a novel model for allocating computing resources in an edge computing platform that allows service providers to establish resource sharing contracts with edge infrastructure providers apriori. Based on the established contracts, service providers employ a latency-aware scheduling and resource provisioning algorithm that enables tasks to complete and meet their latency requirements.

To embrace the upcoming of big data era, many efforts have been devoted to accelerating the MapReduce performance from different aspects, especially intermediate result reusing like Dache. In this paper, we observe that existing intermediate result reusing mechanism is not efficient enough as many I/O operations are wasted. Efficient reusing of the intermediate results could potentially improve the MapReduce performance. Inspired by such fact, we propose a framework named MEMoMR (more efficient intermediate result reusing for MapReduce) by introducing a novel reusing mechanism that can substantially reduce the I/O overhead. To this end, we invent a new metadata description method and apply it in the reusing phase. We practically realize MEMoMR and evaluate its performance by implementing it in a real cluster. The experiment results show that MEMoMR can improve the system performance as high as 23.4%, comparing against Dache.","tags":null,"title":"MEMoMR: Accelerate MapReduce via reuse of intermediate results","type":"publication"}]
