Given infras- tructure costs and the stochastic nature of mobile services’ spatial loads, it is highly desirable to achieve efficient statistical multiplexing amongst such slices. We study a simple dynamic resource sharing policy which allocates a ‘share’ of a pool of (distributed) resources to each slice–Share Constrained Propor- tionally Fair (SCPF). We give a characterization of SCPF’s performance gains over static slicing and general processor sharing. We show that higher gains are obtained when a slice’s spatial load is more ‘imbalanced’ than, and/or ‘orthogonal’ to, the aggregate network load, and that the overall gain across slices is positive. We then address the associated dimensioning problem. Under SCPF, traditional network dimensioning translates to a coupled share dimensioning problem, which characterizes the existence of a feasible share allocation given slices’ expected loads and performance requirements. We provide a solution to robust share dimensioning for SCPF-based network slicing. Slices may wish to unilaterally manage their users’ performance via admission control which maximizes their carried loads subject to performance requirements. We show this can be modeled as a ‘traffic shaping’ game with an achievable Nash equilibrium. Under high loads, the equilibrium is explicitly characterized, as are the gains in the carried load under SCPF vs. static slicing. Detailed simulations of a wireless infrastructure supporting multiple slices with heterogeneous mobile loads show the fidelity of our models and range of validity of our high load equilibrium analysis.","tags":[],"title":"Statistical Multiplexing and Traffic Shaping Games for Network Slicing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kun Fan","S.J.

Our strategy is to detect text regions which we define as part of text lines containing a whole character or transitions between two adjacent characters. We observe that, if we scale text regions to a small and fixed size, their image gradients exhibit certain patterns irrespective of text shapes and language types. Based on this observation, we propose simple features which consist of means and standard deviations of image gradients to train a Random Forest so as to detect text regions over multiple image scales and color channels. Text regions are then merged into text line candidates which are ranked based on the Random Forest re- sponses combined with the shapes of the candidates, e.g., horizontally elongated candidates are given higher scores, because they are more likely to contain texts. Even though our method is trained on English, our experiments demonstrate that it achieves high recall with a few thousand good quality proposals on four stan- dard benchmarks, including multi-language datasets. Following the One-to-One and Many-to-One detection criteria, our method achieves 91.6%, 87.4%, 92.1% and 97.9% recall on the ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Dataset, Street View Text Dataset, Pan’s multilingual Dataset and Sampled KAIST Scene Text Dataset re- spectively, with an average of less than 1250 proposals.","tags":[],"title":"A Robust Proposal Generation Method for Text Lines in Natural Scene Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["CK Pyoung","S.J.

We propose an online virtual network (VN) embedding scheme which jointly considers load balancing and energy saving so as to maximize the profit of Infrastructure Providers (InPs). For load balancing, we propose to minimize a convex objective which penalizes mapping of VNs to overloaded resources. For energy saving, we consider two popular energy models: speed scaling and power-down. In the speed scaling model, energy consumption is modelled as a convex function of the load imposed on resources. We observe that both load-balancing and energy-saving objectives superadditively penalize high utilization/congestion at resources, and that such synergistic nature of the objectives leads to efficient joint optimization. In the power-down model, a fixed cost exists for keeping a node powered on, which is characterized by a nonconvex energy curve. In this case, we propose an iterative algorithm which explores the trade- offs between load balancing versus cost reduction from power-down of idle servers, in a controlled way. Our algorithm performs a sequential node and link mapping; in particular, for link mapping, we adopt randomized rounding with path stripping in order to obtain a constant factor approximation to the minimum penalty for link utilization. Numerical experiments show the efficacy of our algorithm in servicing VN requests of various topologies and resource requirements.","tags":[],"title":"Joint Load Balancing and Energy Saving Algorithm for Virtual Network Embedding in Infrastructure Providers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Our goal is to minimize the delay of transmitting a block of packets to users over time-varying channels using rateless codes. Due to half-duplex operation, at each time slot, the RS can choose to either multicast a packet to the users, or fetch a packet from the macro base station. We formulate a fluid relaxation for the optimal decision problem, and reveal that the optimal policy has a threshold-based structure so as to exploit the opportunism of multicast channel: the RS should multicast only when the channel quality is sufficiently “high”. We propose an online policy based on the relaxation which does not require the knowledge of channel distribution. When the channel distribution is symmetric across users, we provide a closed-form expression of the asymptotic performance of our policy. For two-user systems, we prove that our scheme is asymptotically optimal. When the users’ channels are independent, we derive a performance bound based on water-filling rate allocation which approximates the optimal policy well.

Users can move within the assigned indoor space while carrying a wireless client device with the HMD, without the risk of colliding with obstacles or structures. The system is designed to provide the accurate 3D X, Y, and Z coordinate values of translational movements in real-time as well as the pitch, roll, and yaw values of rotational movements supported by the HMD, resulting in the six degrees of freedom required by immersive virtual reality. In addition, the system utilizes ultrasonic transducers in a grid format, which makes it simple to expand the position tracking coverage area, and supports simultaneous tracking of multiple users.

The RS uses random linear coding to efficiently transmit packets over time-varying multicast channels. Our goal is to minimize the average decoding delay. Because of the half-duplex operation, at each time slot the RS must decide to either (1) fetch a new packet for encoding from the base station, or (2) multicast a coded packet to wireless users. Thus, optimal scheduling hinges on exploiting multicast opportunities while persistently supplying the encoder (at the RS) with new packets. We formulate an associated fluid control problem and show that the optimal policy incorporates opportunism across multicast channels, i.e., the RS performs a multicast transmission only if the collection of channel conditions are favorable; otherwise, it performs a fetch. Based on the fluid policy, we propose an online algorithm.

We propose a novel massively parallelized decoding algorithm leveraging General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) and show its performance enhancement by up to 100% compared with previous GPGPU-based parallel algorithms via experiments on real systems.","tags":[],"title":"A Highly Parallelized Decoder for Random Network Coding leveraging GPGPU","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

In opportunistic feedback schemes, a set of thresholds is assigned to the users, and only users with channel quality above the threshold transmit the feedback on channel state infor- mation (CSI) to the base station. We propose an opportunistic feedback scheme that combines techniques from queue/weight-based opportunistic scheduling to improve users’ delay performance. A set of queue-based weights designed to slowly track variations in users’ backlog is computed; then, each user is assigned a threshold based on the weights. The proposed scheme effectively captures heterogeneity in the offered loads, which is crucial for delay performance. To that end, we formulate a nonconcave maximization problem and propose an approximation algorithm that is numerically shown to have high accuracy. By simulation, we show that our scheme substantially reduces the mean delay, compared with conventional schemes.","tags":[],"title":"Opportunistic Feedback and Scheduling to Reduce Packet Delays in Heterogeneous Wireless Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seung Jun Baek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1328022000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1328022000,"objectID":"44f139d0641ef0ffdcbd817b0c32b4ba","permalink":"https://singkru.github.io/publication/ksii/","publishdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ksii/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a scheme to reduce the overhead associated with channel state information (CSI) feedback required for opportunistic scheduling in wireless access networks. We study the case where CSI is partially overheard by mobiles and thus one can suppress transmitting CSI reports for time varying channels of inferior quality. We model the mechanism of feedback suppression as a Bayesian network, and show that the problem of minimizing the average feedback overhead is NP-hard. To deal with hardness of the problem we identify a class of feedback suppression structures which allow efficient computation of the cost. Leveraging such structures we propose an algorithm which not only captures the essence of seemingly complex overhearing relations among mobiles, but also provides a simple estimate of the cost incurred by a suppression structure.

For a simplified model falling in the classical Markov decision process framework, we numerically compute and characterize mean-delay-optimal scheduling policies. The computed policies ex- hibit radial sum-rate monotonicity: As users’ queues grow linearly, the scheduler allocates service in a manner that deemphasizes the balancing of unequal queues in favor of maximizing current system throughput (being opportunistic). This is in sharp contrast to previously proposed throughput-optimal policies, e.g., Exp rule and MaxWeight (with any positive exponent of queue length). In order to meet performance and robustness objectives, we propose a new class of policies, called the Log rule, that are radial sum-rate monotone (RSM) and provably throughput-optimal. In fact, it can also be shown that an RSM policy minimizes the asymptotic probability of sum-queue overflow. We use extensive simulations to explore various possible design objectives for opportunistic schedulers. When users see heterogenous channels, we find that emphasizing queue balancing, e.g., Exp rule and MaxWeight, may excessively compromise the overall delay. Finally, we discuss approaches to implement the proposed policies for scheduling and resource allocation in OFDMA-based multichannel systems.","tags":[],"title":"Delay-Optimal Opportunistic Scheduling and Approximations: The Log Rule","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seung Jun Baek"," Xiaohan Yu","Kyogu Lee","Hyunhak Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1304175600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1304175600,"objectID":"04a2b4258f10562e0e4a617ef7b53fc2","permalink":"https://singkru.github.io/publication/sensors/","publishdate":"2011-05-01T00:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sensors/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider a problem of retrieving the extreme value among sensed data under deadline constraints in wireless sensor networks with potential applications to alarm systems. The sensed data is mapped to a score which we adopt as a unified measure of the relative urgency of the data. The objective is to retrieve the data with the maximum score. We propose fully distributed schemes for contention based medium access and data combining. The proposed medium access scheme uses a randomized back-off which is controlled based on the score of the data to be transmitted. Data combining techniques are proposed to further suppress unnecessary traffic and reduce contention. The key observation is that one should aggressively prioritize packets with high score, up to an extent that does not incur excessive contention in channel access. Designed to capture such aspect, the proposed scheme is shown to substantially decrease the latency of the retrieval.","tags":[],"title":"Retrieval of the Extreme Values under Deadline Constraints in Wireless Sensor Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
